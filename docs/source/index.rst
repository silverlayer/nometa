Getting started
----------------

NoMETA is available in `PyPI.org <https://pypi.org/>`_, so the recommended method to install is :code:`$ pip install nometa`. Otherwise, you can download the source code and run by yourself.
NoMETA has a command line interface (CLI) that you can run directly. However, only a subset of metadata can be edited by CLI. You can use the command :code:`$ nometa -h` to learn how to execute NoMETA on CLI.

The code snippet below gives a sample of how to use NoMETA programmatically. For more details, explore the left-side menu.
